# number-guesser
In this project I've made a number guesser where you will play against the computer. You have to guess the right number. If you win, you will see the message that you have won. If you lose, the winner gets a point. After every guess, you can see how many times you have won and how many times the computer has won. This was an exercise from Codecademy to practice with Javascript.
